## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to allow for a banking system to be used in games between friends. 
For example, instead of using real money and your actual bank account, this simulated banking system could be used to 
make bets without actually any losing money in real life. 

This project is of interest to me as online games rising in popularity due to COVID, 
I wanted to create a mini-game on top of existing games where people could bet virtual money (eg. "I bet you 500 credits 
that you won't win this game") to foster social connections without the implications of losing actual money.


## User Stories (Phase 1)
- As a user, I want to be able to deposit credits to my bank account. 
- As a user, I want to be able to withdraw credits to my bank account. 
- As a user, I want to be able to see the amount of credits currently in my account. 
- As a user, I want to see a list of previous transactions I've made. 

## User Stories (Phase 2)
- As a user, I want to be able to save the amount of balance in my bank account. 
- As a user, I want to be able to load my bank account with previous transactions and balance. 

## User Stories (Phase 3)
- As a user, I want to see the list of transactions I make. 
- As a user, I want to only see deposit transactions I made.
- As a user, I want to only see withdrawal transactions I made.
- As a user, I want to see the amount of credits currently in my account. 
- As a user, I want to be able to load and save the account. 

## Phase 4: Task 2
Chose to implement first item: "Test and design a class in your model package so that is robust" 
You must have at least one method that throws a checked exception. (Chose to do with Withdrawal Method)


## Phase 4: Task 3 
I would've not done a seperate Main file that calls the Console UI in the ui package, and instead just have it 
implemented within the Bank class (UI) itself like I have done with the BankGUI class. 
This would eliminate the need for a class that is just standalone by itself that has no associations 
with any other class. Otherwise, I wouldn't change my design structure.
