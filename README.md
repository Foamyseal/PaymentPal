# Simple Banking Application 

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to allow for a banking system to be used in games between friends. 
For example, instead of using real money and your actual bank account, this simulated banking system could be used to 
make bets without actually any losing money in real life. 

This project is of interest to me as online games rising in popularity due to COVID, 
I wanted to create a minigame on top of existing games where people could bet virtual money (eg. "I bet you 500 credits 
that you won't win this game") to foster social connections without the implications of losing actual money.
